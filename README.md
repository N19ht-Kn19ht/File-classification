# File-classification
## Installation
First you need to install the tesseract. You also need to install other libraries.
You can do it via "pip" command manager.
## Configuration
Then you need to set a value to tess_cmd_path variable in app.py file. It must be the path to tesseract.exe on your PC.
In my case it is:
tess_cmd_path = "C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe"
